# Four-bar-Linkage-Analysis

This work was done as a homework of Applied Mechanics and Machine course at University.

The main objective of this homework is to lead a complete analysis on a crank-rocker four bar linkage subjected only to its weight.

The analysis has the aim to find and plot the driving torque C<sub>m</sub> and internal constrained reactions as functions of crank's angle.

In particular the analysis follows 4 phases:

- kinematics analysis (both closure equations and newton-raphson methods are used)
- static analysis
- implemantation
- verification obtained with the Principle of Virtual Work.

Technical aspects are:

- the driving member is free to complete a sweep, ranging from 0 to 2Ï€.
- two toggle positions are expected (the overlapping and alignment between crank and rocker).

Moreover, both methods of the kinematics analysis have been implemented in Matlab.

The written part is in italian. I apologize for it to all non italian speaker. If, for any reasons, you are interested in,
